C3PO:
  name: C-3PO
  model: C-3PO v1
  features: His crewmates might be tempted to shut him up or shut him down 
            from time to time, but Threepio’s protocol and translation 
            skills come in handy more than some people may care to admit.

R2D2:
  name: R2-D2
  model: R2-D2 v1
  features: The most famous astromech droid. R2-D2’s memory bank holds 
            countless tales of heroics and tragedy from the Clone Wars, 
            the Rebellion, and the Resistance.  R2-D2 is always there 
            for his masters when they need a holo transmission, a map, 
            or a lightsaber.
